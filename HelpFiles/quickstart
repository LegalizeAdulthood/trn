Trn Quickstart:
   An introduction for people who don't like reading documentation.

This document is a very minimal introduction to most of the new
features of trn.  ** This is very preliminary! **

General:
 +  Use the arrow keys to move around.
 +  When you see a list of selections, use the letter/number keys
    to choose things, then press RETURN.
 +  Typing 'q' will almost always exit what you are currently doing,
    even various command prompts.
 +  Type 'h' (almost) anywhere to get help.  In most places you'll
    enter the help selector, where you can read the trn documentation.
 +  Type 'H' (almost) anywhere to get help on the current commands.

Options:
 +  Type '&' and a RETURN to enter the option selector.
 +  Once you use the 'S'ave command, you'll have a ~/.trn/trnrc
    file that contains the current state of the options.  Trn
    uses this file in preference to your TRNINIT variable _unless_
    you modify the trnrc file manually to tell it to use both
    (or remove the trnrc file).

Multiple News Servers:
 +  Create an access file in your ~/.trn directory -- see the
    Sample Files for a starting point.
 +  Use Ctrl-N and Ctrl-P to switch news servers from the newsgroup
    selector of the newsgroup browser (ala rn).
 +  Optionally, turn on the Newsrc Selector to select a news source
    as you start trn (change the option, save, and restart trn).

...More stuff to come later...
