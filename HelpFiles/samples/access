# This is a sample ~/.trn/access file.

#   This section defines the available news sources and gives them an
# easy-to-use [ID] name.  The always-present ID, "default", can also be
# overriden here, if you so desire.
#   When defining an NNTP server, set "NNTP Server" to the domain name of
# your server.  If you need to use a non-standard port number, append ";119"
# (for example) to the name.  If you want to cache a local copy of the
# active file, set "Active File" to the appropriate name.  If you want
# the file refetched after certain intervals, set "Active File Refetch"
# to the appropriate interval (e.g. "1 day, 5 hours, 3 minutes").
#   When defining a local news source (even NFS mounted), set "Active File"
# and "Spool Dir".
#   Specify "none" for "Overview Dir" and/or "Thread Dir" to disable support
# for that database type, omit or leave blank for the default access (either
# "Spool Dir" for local or XOVER/XTHREAD for remote), or enter a custom
# hierarchy path name.
#   Specify "none" for "Active Times" if the host has no new-group support,
# leave it blank for the default (either active + ".times" for local access
# or the NEWGROUPS command for remote), or enter a custom file name for your
# active.times file.
#   Specify "none" for "Group Desc" if you don't have a file with newsgroup
# descriptions, leave it blank for the default (NEWSLIB/newsgroups for local
# access or the XGTITLE/LIST_NEWSGROUPS command for remote), or enter a
# custom file name for your newsgroups file.  If this is an NNTP source
# you can also set "Group Desc Refetch" to a time value when the file
# expires (something like "7 days" might be good).
#   Set Auth User and Auth Password if you need to specify them to use a
# news server.  On the other hand, if you're using the "generic
# authentication" system, use the Auth Command setting instead.
#   If the server is poorly behaved and doesn't ask you for your
# authentication, you can set Force Auth to "yes" to have trn force the
# info onto the server.
#   Add "XHDR Broken = y" if your server doesn't properly respond to
# XHDR requests (articles vanish unexpectedly).

# This section tells trn what newsrc groups you want to use.  If you
# define multiple entries with the same group number, all of the .newsrcs
# are combined and used together.  The first entry encountered will be
# the first group that trn will open.  Otherwise the numbers dictate the
# presentation order (see Ctrl-N and Ctrl-P).  You can have multiple
# .newsrc's from the same server or different servers, however you like.
# The ID name "default" always exists with your compiled-in defaults.

# If you leave off the newsrc name, the default is supplied.  If you
# don't want any groups added to an rc, specify "no" in the "Add Groups"
# field.  If you don't want new-group checking but want to manually
# add groups, specify "manual".  The default is "yes".
