#### default_topic "top" topic file
## To install this file as the default topic file, do the following:
#
# 1.  Read the comments in the topic file below, and change entries as
#     appropriate.
#
# 2.  Move this file ("default_topic") to the trn library directory
#     (the same directory which contains the INIT and newsnews files).
#     This will be done by "make install.full" or "make install.strn"
#     if the library directory does not have a default_topic file.
#
## Users can override the default hierarchy by setting SCANGROUPS
## to point elsewhere, or by creating a ~/News/scangroups/top file.
## The easiest way to do this is to enter group scan mode, and select
## "Create a personalized top file for group scan mode" from the menu.
## Users can then add items to their own "top" file.

###Start of the default topic file

## Probably a good idea to start with this newsgroup--the user can always
## unsubscribe if s/he wishes.
news.announce.newusers
# Include an easy way to get to all the newsgroups
"All newsgroups" *

#A neat way to introduce the net to newbies...
"Newsgroups by hierarchies" %X/hier_groups

## Use a line like the following to make local newsgroups more obvious.
#"Widget Factory local news" widget.*

# Change the following line to point to any local hierarchy structures.
#"Default Hierarchy" /foo/bar/lib/strn/top

## If users write useful hierarchies, they can be shared by adding links
## to them.  For instance, the following would link to some of Mary's topics:
#"Mary's computer hierarchy" ~mary/News/scangroups/comp/main

## Any other shared topics/hierarchies can be added here.

##This entry will point to the user's hotlist.strn file.
"Personal Hotlist" @%p/hotlist.strn

#Uncomment the following for WWW stuff (not fully supported yet).
#"Strn WWW home page." URL:http://www.digex.net/~caadams/strn/strn.top
