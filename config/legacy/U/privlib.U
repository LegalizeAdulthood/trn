?S:privlib:
?S:	This variable contains the eventual value of the PRIVLIB symbol,

?S:	have a ~ on the front. It is up to the makefile to eventually create
?S:	this directory while performing installation (with ~ substitution).
?S:.
?S:privlibexp:
?S:	This variable is the ~name expanded version of privlib, so that you
?S:	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.
?S:.
?S:installprivlib:
?S:	This variable is really the same as privlibexp but may differ on
?S:	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
?S:	should be used in makefiles.
?S:.
?C:PRIVLIB:
?C:	This symbol contains the name of the private library for this package.
?C:	The library is private in the sense that it needn't be in anyone's
?C:	execution path, but it should be accessible by the world.  The program
?C:	should be prepared to do ~ expansion.
?C:.
?C:PRIVLIB_EXP:
?C:	This symbol contains the ~name expanded version of PRIVLIB, to be used
?C:	in programs that are not prepared to deal with ~ expansion at run-time.

There are some auxiliary files for $package that need to be put into a
private library directory that is accessible by everyone.

$cat <<EOM

To install the files in this directory, a few strange systems need
to use a different directory name to get the files there.
