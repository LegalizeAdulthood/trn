This directory contains test cases for some newly written functions
that can be unit tested.

To test changes to the existing code base it's necessary to link in
the entire trn.  To do this stub.c is generated from trn.c by
renaming main; this enables the linking to succeed but if any of the
tested functions depends on some sort of initialization performed by
trn main() then we're screwed.
