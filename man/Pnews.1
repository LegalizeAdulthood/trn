.SH NAME
Pnews - a program for posting news articles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Pnews newsgroup title
.br
  or
.br
.B Pnews -h headerfile [oldarticle]
.br
  or
.br
.B Pnews
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pnews is a friendly interface for posting news articles.
It will ask several questions, then allow you to enter your article,
and then post it using the inews(1) program.
If you type h and a carriage return at any point,
.I Pnews
will tell you what it wants to know.
.PP
If you put a
.I .signature
file in your home directory, your inews program will usually append it
to your message after you are done editing it.
If you prefer to see your signature while you are editing, rename your
\&.signature file to be .news_sig and it will be appended before you
begin to edit.
Note that .news_sig obeys the setting of DOTDIR, but .signature may
not, since it is out of Pnews's control.
If both .news_sig and .signature exist you'll get two signatures appended.
.PP
The -h form is used when invoked from
.I trn
or
.IR rn .
If your editor can edit multiple files, and you want the article to which
you are replying to show up as an alternate file, define the environment
variable NEWSPOSTER as \*(L"Pnews -h %h %A\*(R".
You can also modify the the NEWSHEADER environment variable to change the
header file that
.I [t]rn
passes to Pnews.
