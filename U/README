This directory contains all of trn's custom metaconfig units, which
are used to build the Configure script (metaconfig automatically looks
in this "U" dir for them when it is run).  Configure should not be
modified directly.  The units that comprise it should be tweaked and
Configure rebuilt.

To be able to rebuild Configure, you need "metaconfig", which is
included as a part of the "dist" distribution.  I have patched the
most recent release of dist with some units from the perl project and
placed it in the ftp directory for trn (on trn.sourceforge.net).  You
should use this version in preference to the last released "dist"
distribution until (and unless) the official release gets updated with
the relevant changes.

After installing "dist", here's what you need to do:

 + In the main trn4 source directory, make sure you've pulled the
   latest source.  I have included the .package file that metaconfig
   looks for, and I have also included a helper script named fixConf
   that I use when building Configure.

 + Copy the MANIFEST file to MANIFEST.new (metaconfig refuses to run
   without this file -- you can remove it when you're done).

 + Run "metaconfig" to generate a "Wanted" file, a new "Configure",
   and a new config_h.SH.  In the future, you can run metaconfig with
   the -w option if you are sure that the "Wanted" file is up-to-date
   (this speeds things up quite a bit).

 + Run the "fixConf" perl script to tidy up Configure a bit.  

 + Run "cvs diff" to see what changes were made.

 + Try out the new Configure (as required).

 + Run "cvs commit" to commit the new Configure and/or config_h.SH
   files.
